            <h4>Thanks for stopping by!</h4>
            <p>We are FRC Team 3187, the Arcadia Titans. We have been participants in the FIRST Robotics Competition for the past 5 years, and we are very excited to be starting our second year of VRC as team 3187A this school year. We have very strong student leadership, and we are driven and committed to giving all that we can to making our team successful. We hope that in the upcoming years, we will grow and thrive as we become more active members of our community, and that we will remain as strong a team as we are now.</p>
