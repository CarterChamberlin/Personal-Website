            <h3>Help us reach our goals for the future.</h3>
            <p>We are always looking for students, mentors and sponsors to become members and help contribute to our team!</p>
            <h4>Students</h4>
            <p>We have open membership to any student at Arcadia High School. If you are a student who is interested in Engineering, Programming, Marketing, Photography, or Design, we would love to have you become a part of our team! We are completely student run, and our team members have a wide variety of skills. The best part is: NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IS REQUIRED TO JOIN! We will teach you everything you need to know. Absolutely anyone is welcome to be a member of the team! If you are interested in joining, look for us at Club Rush, or Contact Us for more information.</p>
            <h4>Mentors</h4>
            <p>Do you have any skills in Engineering, Programming, Marketing, CAD, or Web? We would love to have you as a member of our team. As a mentor, you would be helping to guide our students through the process of building, programming and testing a competitive robot, as well as marketing our team, fundraising, getting sponsors, and much more! If you are interested in becoming a team mentor, Contact Us.</p>
            <h4>Sponsors</h4>
            <p>Our sponsors are very important to our team. Without them, we wouldnâ€™t be able to build a robot, let alone compete. By sponsoring our team, you are supporting STEM education in Arcadia High School and our community, and you are helping us to reach our goals for the future. All of our sponsors will have their name and logo visible on our robot, banners, and t-shirts. Contact Us for more information.</p>
